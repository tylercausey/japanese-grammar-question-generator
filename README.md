# japanese-grammar-question-generator
This web app allows users to input a Japanese passage of their choice, be it from a news article, blog, etc. into a text box, and from it generate a quiz question using a randomly selected Japanese grammar point from a database that is found in a random sentence of the passage.
The question will blank out the grammar point where it is used in the sentence, and provide 4 multiple choice answer options using the correct
grammar point and 3 other randomly selected incorrect grammar points. In further iterations of this app I would like to add in user logins
and accounts where users can save questions or grammar points for later review in addition to increasing the number of grammar points in the 
database.
